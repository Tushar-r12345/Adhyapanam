              <p className="para1">
                Our aim is to provide excellent and free courses to all of the
                students belonging from class 6th to class 12th of any board
                (CBSE,ICSE etc.) with quality content. In india there are many
                students who can't afford the high demanding fees of good
                instituitions so they can not get quality education and good
                mentor as well. So, here we came up with little startup to help
                students like you. Hope, you find this website useful.
