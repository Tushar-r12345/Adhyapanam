# Adhyapanam
**Introduction :** Adhyapanam is an educational portal to help students belonging to poor family to provide them free education with the mentorship from great teachers through online mode. It is an opportunity for students to clear their doubts from the teachers at the time which will be scheduled by teacher.

**Problem:** The pandemic posed several challenges in public and private school which included an expected rise in dropouts, learning losses, and increase in digital divide. The pandemic also called into question the readiness of the systems, including teachers to address such a crisis and sustainability of private and goverment schools.

**Methodology:** We have built a platform where students can come and learn from the best faculty of the country. We have build two portals first for the mentor where he/she can register and schedule classes , class tests, etc for their students and second portal for students which helps them to see the classes and allow them to join or connect with their mentors. We have designed a user friendly and interactive UI which is easy to use for both students and mentors.

**Advantages:**

(2) Students can get their doubts clarified during lectures, by posting queries in discussion forums.
